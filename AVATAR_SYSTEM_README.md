# User-Specific Avatar System

## Overview
The avatar system has been updated to properly handle user-specific avatars, ensuring that each user's avatar is stored and retrieved independently. This solves the previous issue where avatars were shared between different users.

## How It Works

### 1. User Identification
- Each user is identified by their email address
- The email is stored in SharedPreferences under the key `user_email`
- This email is used to create user-specific storage keys for avatars

### 2. Avatar Storage
- Avatars are stored with user-specific keys: `avatarUrl_{userEmail}`
- Example: `avatarUrl_john@example.com` for user john@example.com
- This ensures complete isolation between different users' avatars

### 3. AvatarService Updates
The `AvatarService` class has been enhanced with the following new methods:

- `setCurrentUser(String userEmail)`: Sets the current user and loads their avatar
- `getUserAvatar(String userEmail)`: Gets avatar for a specific user without switching
- Enhanced `updateAvatar()`: Automatically saves to the correct user-specific key
- Enhanced `clearAvatar()`: Clears avatar for the current user only
- Enhanced `reset()`: Clears all user data including user email

### 4. User Lifecycle Management

#### Login
- User email is stored in SharedPreferences
- AvatarService is set to the current user
- User's avatar is loaded from their specific storage key

#### App Usage
- AvatarService maintains the current user context
- All avatar operations are performed in the context of the current user
- Avatars are automatically saved to user-specific keys

#### Logout
- User-specific avatar data is cleared
- User email is removed from SharedPreferences
- AvatarService is reset to prevent data leakage

## Key Benefits

1. **User Isolation**: Each user's avatar is completely separate
2. **No Data Leakage**: Previous user's avatar won't appear for new users
3. **Proper Cleanup**: User data is properly cleared on logout
4. **Backward Compatibility**: Existing functionality is preserved
5. **Scalability**: System can handle multiple users without conflicts

## Implementation Details

### Storage Keys
- `user_email`: Stores the current user's email
- `avatarUrl_{userEmail}`: Stores avatar URL for specific user

### AvatarService Methods
```dart
// Set current user and load their avatar
await avatarService.setCurrentUser('user@example.com');

// Update avatar (automatically saves to user-specific key)
await avatarService.updateAvatar('https://example.com/avatar.jpg');

// Get avatar for specific user
final avatar = await avatarService.getUserAvatar('user@example.com');

// Clear current user's avatar
await avatarService.clearAvatar();

// Reset all user data
await avatarService.reset();
```

### Integration Points
- **Login**: Stores user email and sets current user
- **Profile Loading**: Automatically loads user-specific avatar
- **Avatar Upload**: Saves to user-specific storage
- **Logout**: Clears user-specific data
- **App Resume**: Refreshes user-specific avatar

## Testing
A comprehensive test suite has been created in `test_user_specific_avatar.dart` that verifies:
- User-specific avatar storage and retrieval
- Avatar isolation between different users
- Proper cleanup on logout
- Complete data reset functionality

## Migration Notes
- Existing avatars stored under the old `avatarUrl` key will be migrated automatically
- The system gracefully handles cases where user email is not set
- All existing avatar functionality continues to work as before

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Avatar not showing**: Check if user email is properly set
2. **Wrong avatar displayed**: Verify current user context
3. **Avatar persistence**: Ensure proper logout cleanup

### Debug Information
The system provides detailed logging for debugging:
- Avatar initialization
- User switching
- Storage operations
- Error conditions

## Future Enhancements
- Support for multiple avatar formats
- Avatar caching and optimization
- Backup and restore functionality
- Cloud synchronization
